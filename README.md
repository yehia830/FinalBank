A command line application that allows a user to enter information about his/her bank accounts and then perform transactions on those accounts.
## Objective
The goal of this project is to allow any amount of users to login and create any amount of bank accounts, and preform transcations (including saving,withdrawl,and transfer) on those created bank accounts.
The Bank will also save each user's file so whenever they log back in all of their information is present.
The Bank will also accure interest over time if the type of account is either saving or retirement.
